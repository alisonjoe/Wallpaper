In today's image, we see four burrowing owls in Wyoming, USA, standing near their burrow, looking like a band of mischievous siblings. Known for their distinctive white eyebrows and yellow eyes, these owls are active during the day, hunting insects and small mammals. These resilient species, capable of surviving for at least 9 years in the wild and surpassing 10 years in captivity, face numerous threats in their environment. Predation from various sources, including badgers, coyotes, snakes and both feral and domesticated pets like cats and dogs, poses a constant danger to its survival. The burrowing owl exhibits remarkable adaptive behaviours, such as nesting and roosting in abandoned ground burrows of armadillos, prairie dogs or skunks. When confronted with danger, the owl retreats to these burrows and emits rattling and hissing sounds.
