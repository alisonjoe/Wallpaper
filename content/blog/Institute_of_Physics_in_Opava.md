What glows in the night?This night a combination of usual and unusual glows.Perhaps the most usual glow was from, a potentially familiar object.The full Moon's nearly results from the observer being near.As the Moon sets, ands in preferentially scatter out blue light, makingthe appear reddish whennear the horizon.                                                                                                                                             Perhaps the mostwas from the bioluminescent, likely less familiar objects.These  glow blue, it is thought, primarily toand.In this case, the glow was caused primarily byplankton-containing waves crashing onto the beach.The image was taken on, just overone year ago.
