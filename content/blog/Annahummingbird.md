Meet the tiny, feathered acrobat that flitters in the skies. Anna's hummingbird was named after a French courtier, Anna de Belle Massena, Duchess of Rivoli. We can enjoy the year-round presence of these birds in Canada since they can withstand cooler climates and are able to slow down their metabolism, a state known as torpor. Anna's hummingbirds, weighing less than a loonie, have a wingspan of 12 centimetres. They can beat their wings over 40-50 times per second, enabling them to hover and even fly backwards with ease.
