How  formed, including its nearly  of stars and gas, remains unknown. Genesis hypotheses include abillions of years ago and the gravitational effect of a that has.The  was taken by theand reprocessed using an . Observations in  indicate that  has  accreted a smaller galaxy in the past billion years.  spans about 100,000 and lies about 600 million  away toward the  of the Snake().  Many galaxies far in the distance are visible toward the right, while , visible in the gap at about seven o'clock, is another but more distant .
