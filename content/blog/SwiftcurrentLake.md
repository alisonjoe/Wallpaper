Join us as we celebrate the American wilderness on National Park Service Founders Day. Today we honor the foresight of visionaries who spearheaded the creation of the NPS. This organization was established by President Woodrow Wilson to conserve wildlife, maintain natural landscapes, preserve historical artifacts, and offer educational programs. You can enjoy this day by visiting one of 429 national parks in the country and diving into ranger-led programs, volunteer efforts, and celebratory events to learn more about the history.
