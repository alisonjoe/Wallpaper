In the heart of the wilderness, an awe-inspiring sight plummets from a mountain—the Churún Merú waterfall in Venezuela! Also known as Dragon Falls, the cascade featured in today's image is in a narrow niche at the southern end of the canyon that divides the mountain of Auyan Tepui. Falling from around 396 metres, Churún Merú is joined by a neighboring stream in the wet season. Venezuela is home to some of the world's most impressive natural wonders, including the highest waterfall on Earth, Angel Falls, found some 6 kilometres south of Churún Marú. James Angel, who is often wrongly credited with finding Angel Falls, may have discovered the Dragon waterfall. Something that supports this theory is the fact that Angel Falls is often misidentified as the Dragon Falls. So, whether you're after Angels or Dragons, Venezuela has a waterfall for you!
