Let us turn the pages of history to the formation of Maharashtra! Commemorating the state's birth on May 1, 1960, Maharashtra Day is celebrated annually with parades, political addresses, ceremonies and many other public and private gatherings. Following the enactment of the Bombay Reorganisation Act, 1960, the boundaries of Maharashtra and Gujarat were decided based on languages spoken in different areas of the region. Being India's second-most populous states, and one of its most industrialised, Maharashtra is split into 36 districts and 6 divisions.
