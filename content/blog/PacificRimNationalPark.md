Deep green temperate rainforests alternate with rocky shores, and sandy beaches on the west coast of Vancouver Island. Let's visit the Pacific Rim National Park Reserve! The area that spreads across 511 square kilometres was recognised as a national park in 1970. The Nuu-chah-nulth First Nations of the region have walked these lands for centuries. Today, seven of the 15 Nuu-chah-nulth tribes have at least 22 small reserves within the park and nine bordering it. Another notable feature of the reserve is the Coastal Western Hemlock Biogeoclimatic Zone. This temperate forest terrain is home to several animal species such as black bears, Vancouver Island cougars and martens.
