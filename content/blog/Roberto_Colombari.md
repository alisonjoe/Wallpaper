  ,also known as 30 Doradus, is more than a thousand light-years in diameter,a giant star forming region within nearby satellite galaxy the.About 180 thousand light-years away, it's the largest,most violent star forming region known in the whole LocalGroup of galaxies.The cosmic arachnid sprawls across,an assembly of image data from large space- and ground-based telescopes. (NGC 2070),intense radiation, stellar winds, and supernova shocksfrom the central young cluster of massive stars cataloged as R136energize the nebular glow and shape the spidery filaments. are other star forming regions withyoung star clusters, filaments, and blown-out clouds.In fact, the frame includes the site of the closest supernova in,at lower right.The rich field of view spans about 2 degreesor 4 full moons in the southern.But were the Tarantula Nebula closer, say 1,500 light-years distant likethe Milky Way's own star forming ,it would take up half the sky.
