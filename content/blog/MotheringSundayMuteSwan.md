As spring breathes new life into the world, a time-honoured tradition—Mothering Sunday—is a time to celebrate the nurturing spirit of mothers. It might be often called Mother's Day in the United Kingdom, but it has no connection with the American Mother's Day. This holiday's roots stretch back to the 16th century when it was a day for folks to return to their 'mother church' for a special service on the fourth Sunday of Lent. Over time, it has morphed into a day to honour mothers.
