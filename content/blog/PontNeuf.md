Today marks the start of the Summer Olympics in Paris. The City of Light becomes the second city, after London, to host the Summer Olympics for a third time. What makes these Games truly unique is the opening ceremony: Rather than in a stadium, participants will parade along the Seine on a flotilla of boats, passing under the Pont Neuf, pictured here, and cheered by spectators lining both banks. Paris is no stranger to historic firsts; the 1900 Games in the city was where women competed for the first time, although only 22 out of 997 athletes were women.
