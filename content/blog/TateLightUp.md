Happy International Women's Day! We celebrate IWD with London's famous Tate Modern art gallery, lit up in purple. Why purple? The colour associated with IWD symbolises dignity, justice and dedication to the matter. This event celebrates women's achievements in politics, culture and society. Every year on March 8, educational and cultural activities, demonstrations, campaigns and discussions highlight the importance of gender equality and women's rights.
