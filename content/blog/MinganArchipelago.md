Set sail through time and explore the Mingan Archipelago National Park Reserve. Surrounded by the waters of the Gulf of Saint Lawrence, this cluster of over 2,000 islands and islets is spread across the rugged coast of Quebec's Côte-Nord. In the archipelago, limestone monoliths have been carved by the persistent hands of erosion for aeons. The reserve was established in 1984, offering sanctuary not just to these geological wonders, but also to a rich tapestry of biodiversity. While here, travellers can spot nearly 200 species of birds, like bald eagles, common eider and terns, while feeling the stoic gaze of Atlantic puffins following them, making it a haven for birdwatchers. Come and enjoy the beauty of Mingan Archipelago National Park Reserve, where the whispers of history ride the salty sea breeze.
