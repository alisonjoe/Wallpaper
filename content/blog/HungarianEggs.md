Happy Easter! Do you like your eggs boiled or painted? The practice of painting chicken eggs, which originates from Persian traditions, was adopted by Christians in the early 17th century to commemorate this holiday, also called Pascha. Hungarian artist, Tünde Csuhaj—living and working in the small city of southern Hungary, Szekszárd—has mastered the craft. The internationally recognised egg-painter developed her own etching technique to create lace-like patterns. The meticulous designs appear on all sorts of eggs, including chicken, goose, swan and even emu or ostrich eggs. The intricate motifs of incredible craftsmanship are often shown at national and international fairs and exhibitions. Are you inspired? Grab a paintbrush and test your egg-painting skills.
