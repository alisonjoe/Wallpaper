In the sun-kissed orchards of the Golden State, almonds reign supreme, enticing the taste buds and adorning the natural surroundings. California grows 80 percent of the world's commercial supply, and 100 percent of the United States'. Almonds have heart-healthy monounsaturated fats and are nutritional powerhouses, packed with fibre, protein and an array of vitamins and minerals. During February and March, in California's Central Valley, these seeds—not nuts—emerge from the delicate blossoms of the almond tree and mature within a protective, fuzzy hull. These trees, which belong to the rose family, burst into a spectacle of beauty during full bloom, with fragrant flowers painting the orchards in hues of white and pink.
