Hold on to your turbans, folks! We're stepping into the realm of Amber! Atop a hill, overlooking the Maota Lake, lies the Amber Fort in the town of Amer, just 11 kilometres from Jaipur, Rajasthan. Amber, initially a Meena state governed by the Susawat clan, became the capital of Dhundhar after Kakil Deo defeated the Susawats. Later, Dulha Rai, a Kachhwaha prince, established Kachwaha dominance over Dhundhar. Kacchwaha lineage's Raja Shri Maan Singh who was also one of Emperor Akbar's trusted generals, initiated the construction of this majestic fort in 1592.
