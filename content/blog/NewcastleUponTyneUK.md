Nestled on the banks of the River Tyne, Newcastle Upon Tyne's story is one of transformation. Amongst its cobbled streets and historic buildings lies a treasure trove of tales. The city started life as Pons Aelius, a Roman settlement. It was on this site that the Norman fortress that gave the city its name was built. During the Middle Ages, the city was an important trading power, while during Victorian age, its shipbuilding and engineering works made Newcastle a vital part of the Industrial Revolution.
