Embark on a sensory journey through Munnar's famed tea plantations! Situated amid the misty heights of the Western Ghats Mountain range, Munnar is a hill station and town in the Idukki district of Kerala. At approximately 1,600 metres above sea level, the town boasts a landscape characterised by rolling hills, lush valleys and verdant tea plantations. In the 1880s, European settlers established the first tea plantations in the region, marking the beginning of a flourishing industry that would shape the landscape and economy for decades to come.
