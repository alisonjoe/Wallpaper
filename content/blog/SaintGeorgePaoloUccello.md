Are you ready to wave your flags and celebrate all things English? Saint George's Day has rolled around once again. Today is a commemoration the death of the patron saint of England who was a Roman soldier famed for his dragon-slaying. This feast day is not just about honouring the saint, it's also about celebrating English culture and heritage. From dragon-themed parades in Derby to traditional feasts fit for a king, there's something for everyone to enjoy. Coincidently, today also marks the birth and death dates of William Shakespeare. So, don a rose, raise your glass and let's hear it for all things English!
