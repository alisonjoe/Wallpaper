Lace up those sneakers, channel your inner Mo Farah and get ready to join the ranks of marathon legends. This year, the London Marathon is back in its usual spring spot! This second-largest annual race in the United Kingdom will see runners from all walks (or runs) of life come together to tackle the ultimate challenge: 26.2 miles of pure grit and determination. Starting off at one of the three start lines (blue, green and red) between Greenwich and Blackheath, runners weave their way through the streets of the capital city, passing historic landmarks like Tower Bridge and Buckingham Palace. Moreover, the London Marathon isn't just about personal glory; it's also about giving back. With millions of pounds raised for charity each year, every step these runners take helps make the world a better place.
