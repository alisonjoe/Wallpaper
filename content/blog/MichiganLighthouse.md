Amid dusky hues, lighthouses mark where Lake Michigan meets the St. Joseph River. In the 19th century, two piers were built on Lake Michigan, one either side of the mouth of the St. Joseph River to help protect ships sailing upstream. In the early 20th century, a lighthouse was built at the end of each pier. These were the St. Joseph North Pier Inner and Outer Lights, pictured here. Lighthouses at the end of the piers were added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2005.
