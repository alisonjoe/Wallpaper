Welcome to Kerala! From the spice gardens of Wayanad to the tea plantations of Munnar, the state's landscape is a feast for the senses. Located along the Malabar Coast in southwestern India, Kerala is characterised by an intricate network of lakes, hill stations, brackish canals, estuaries, beaches and rivers. Featured in today's image are the backwaters, which are a nexus of several water bodies, often likened to bayous, stretching over 900 kilometres.
