In the heart of Carmarthenshire, Wales, near the River Tywi estuary, stands Llansteffan Castle. This historical gem dates to the 12th century when the Normans decided to mark their territory in this strategic spot. With sweeping views over the estuary and the countryside, it's not hard to see why they chose this location. The castle served as a focal point in the tug-of-war between the Normans and the native Welsh princes, witnessing numerous battles and sieges. These days, the castle, which is now privately owned, is in ruins, although a few structures are still standing. While the two-tower Gatehouse greets visitors, the castle's stone walls enclose an Iron Age promontory fort. So, if you ever find yourself in Carmarthenshire, consider a detour to Llansteffan.
