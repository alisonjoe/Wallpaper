Eighty years ago, on the beaches of Normandy, northern France, an event unfolded that would alter the course of history. This day on June 6, 1944, marked the launch of Operation Overlord, the ambitious Allied invasion that became a turning point in World War II. The audacious assault by sea, air and land involved nearly 160,000 troops.
