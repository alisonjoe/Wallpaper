National Indigenous Peoples Day is observed on June 21 to honour the rich cultures, languages and traditions of First Nations, Inuit and Métis communities. It was established in 1996 to highlight Indigenous peoples' resilience, creativity and their imprints on the country's multicultural tapestry. On this day, communities come together to celebrate through music, dance, art and traditions.
