Pictured here are mangroves, resilient shrubs or trees, thriving in the challenging environments of coastal saline or brackish waters. These shrubs, known for their intricate network of stilt roots, play a crucial ecological role. Acting as 'green shields,' they provide essential protection against coastal erosion and help mitigate the potentially catastrophic effects of natural calamities. Having evolved unique mechanisms to absorb additional oxygen and expel salt, they endure conditions that are fatal to most flora. Their intricate salt filtration and robust roots enable them to withstand saltwater submersion and wave impact, while thriving in the low-oxygen mud of the intertidal zone's upper regions. Analysis of satellite imagery in 2014 has unveiled this hidden ecological treasure along Karnataka's coast. Despite mangroves being traditionally associated with India's east coast, Karnataka boasts a significant expanse of these vibrant saline-water ecosystems.
