  Forget  — imagine what you could see with  vision! The  shows what the universe looks like to NASA's . Fermi sees light with energies about a billion times what the  can see, and  combines 12 years of Fermi observations. The colors represent the brightness of the , with brighter sources appearing lighter in color. The prominent stripe across the middle is the central plane of our . Most of the red and yellow dots scattered above and below the Milky Way’s plane are very , while most of those within  are nearby . The  background that fills the image is the  from distant sources that are too dim to be detected individually. Some gamma-ray sources  and topics of research — currently  what they are.
