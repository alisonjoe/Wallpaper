This sleepy koala may inspire you to catch some Z's. These adorable Australian marsupials can sleep up to 20 hours a day, which helps them conserve the little energy they get from their eucalyptus-based diet. Koalas move slowly when awake, spend most of their time tucked into nooks in trees, and have a lower body temperature than other animals of their size. The koala is an arboreal herbivorous marsupial, it is uniquely adapted to its native habitat. Typically found in coastal areas of Australia's eastern and southern regions, including Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia, the koala's stout, tailless body and distinctive features, such as its large head with round, fluffy ears and dark nose, make it easily recognisable.
