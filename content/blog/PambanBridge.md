Get ready to explore the offbeat charm of Rameswaram Island! Occupying a significant position between peninsular India and Sri Lanka, this island, also known as Pamban Island, is within the Adam's Bridge (Ram Setu) archipelago. As the second-largest island in the region, it is anchored by the pilgrimage hub of Rameswaram, a bustling town steeped in spiritual significance. Here, spanning across the waters of the Indian Ocean, Pamban Bridge is a vital railway link, connecting the town of Mandapam on mainland India with Rameswaram on the Island. Another wonder covered in today's snapshot is the quaint town of Dhanushkodi, situated in the embrace of Rameswaram island. This town attracts travellers with its rich history and natural splendour. Once a well inhabited place, it is now a ghost town, though its weather-beaten ruins still make it a must-visit tourist destination.
