As spring unfurls its colours across Vancouver, Queen Elizabeth Park showcases a sight that captures the hearts of visitors. Imagine strolling beneath the cherry blossoms as their delicate petals drift through the air like confetti. Originally a basalt quarry, the site was transformed into a municipal park in the 1930s. In 1939, it was dedicated by King George VI and Queen Elizabeth during their visit to Vancouver, hence its name. The park is a cultural hub with features like sculptures, walking trails, a conservatory and recreational facilities.
