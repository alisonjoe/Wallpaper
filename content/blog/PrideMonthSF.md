June is Pride Month, commemorating the Stonewall uprising, a series of protests by the LGBTQIA+ community that took place on June 28, 1969, in response to a police raid at the Stonewall Inn in Greenwich Village in New York City. Various events around the world are held in June to honour and celebrate the LGBTQIA+ community, their history, achievements and ongoing pursuit for equality. This month, vibrant parades hit the streets and buildings light up in the colours of the rainbow—a symbol of the LGBTQIA+ social movements—in numerous cities to praise freedom for all.
