At 931 metres high, Skiddaw is the fourth tallest peak in England's Lake District. It carries an air of grandeur, thanks to the flatter valleys that set it apart from neighbouring fells. Author Alfred Wainwright once called the summit 'an affable and friendly giant.' Skiddaw is more than a mountaineer's playground—it's steeped in geological wonder. It is formed from ancient Ordovician slate that musicians have turned into lithophones, charming visitors at Keswick Museum with their melodic chime. Moreover, Skiddaw House, originally a keeper's lodge built in 1829, tells tales of its rich heritage through walls that have witnessed the evolution of this landscape. Whether you're a seasoned fell runner beginning the Bob Graham Round—a fell running challenge—or a day-tripper seeking a summit, Skiddaw invites all.
