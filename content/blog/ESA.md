  What kind of celestial object is this?A relatively normal galaxy -- but seen from its edge. Many disk galaxies are actually just as thin as NGC 5866, the Spindle galaxy, , but are not  from our vantage point.  A perhaps more familiar galaxy seen edge-on is our own . Also cataloged as M102, the  has numerous and complex dust lanes appearing dark and red, while many of the bright stars in the disk give it a more blue underlying hue. The blue disk of young  can be seen in this  image extending past the  in the extremely .There is evidence that the  galaxy has cannibalized smaller galaxies over the past billion years or so, including  of faint stars, dark dust that extends away from the main galactic plane, and a  of galaxies (not shown). In general, many  because the gas that  collides with itself as it rotates about the gravitational center.The  lies about 50 million  distant toward the constellation of the Dragon().
