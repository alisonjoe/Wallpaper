  Why does this galaxy have such a long tail? In this stunning vista, based on image data from the ,distant galaxies form a dramatic backdrop for disrupted spiral 188, the Tadpole Galaxy.The  is a mere 420 million light-years distant toward thenorthern constellation of the Dragon ().Its  tail is about 280 thousand s long and features massive, bright blue star clusters.One  goesthat a more compact intruder galaxy crossed in front of  - from right to left in this view - and was behind the  by their gravitational attraction.During the, tidal forces drew out the stars, gas, and dustforming the spectacular tail.The  galaxy itself, estimated tolie about 300 thousand light-years behind the Tadpole,can be seen through foreground spiral arms at the upper right.its terrestrial , the  will likely lose as it grows older, the tail's star clustersforming smaller satellites of the large spiral galaxy.
