 To some, it looks like a penguin.But to people who study the universe, it is an interesting example of two big galaxies interacting.Just a few hundred million years ago, the upper NGC 2936 was likely a : spinning, creating stars, and minding its own business. Then it got too close to the massive  NGC 2937, below, and took a dive. Together known as , they are  in this new   image, while a   image appears in comparison. NGC 2936 is not only being deflected, but , by this close gravitational interaction. When massive galaxies  each other, gas is typically condensed from which . A  of stars appears as the nose of the  toward the right of the upper galaxy, while in the center of the , bright stars together appear as an eye. Before a billion years, the  into one larger galaxy.
