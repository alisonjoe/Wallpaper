The countdown to the official start of spring has begun, accompanied by constantly emerging blooms. The tulips of the Fraser Valley, seen in today's image, are bursting with vibrant colour in preparation for the Abbotsford Tulip Festival in April. Abbotsford's fertile soil is fed by the Fraser River, which runs through the northern border of the city.
