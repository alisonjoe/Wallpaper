Within the Thanjavur District of Tamil Nadu, tucked away amidst the tranquil landscapes of Darasuram, Kumbakonam, is a hidden gem of Dravidian architecture—the Airavatesvara Temple. This Hindu sanctuary, constructed under the patronage of Chola Emperor Rajaraja II during the 12th century CE, holds the esteemed status of being a UNESCO World Heritage Site. This sacred site pays homage to the traditions of Shaktism and Vaishnavism, along with Shaivism.
