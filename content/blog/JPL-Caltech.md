  What happens to a star that goes near a black hole?If the star directly impacts a massive , then the star falls in completely -- and everything vanishes., though, the star goes close enough to have the black hole's gravity pull away its outer layers, or .Then, most of the star's gas does not fall into the . These stellar  events can be as bright as a supernova, and an increasing amount of them are being discovered by automated .In the , a star has just passed a massive  and sheds gas that continues to orbit. The inner edge of a disk of gas and dust  is heated by the  and may  long after the star  is gone.
