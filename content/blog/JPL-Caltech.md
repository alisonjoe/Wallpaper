  Looping through the Jovian system in the late 1990s, therecorded stunning views of Europa and uncoveredevidence that the moon's icy surface likely hidesa deep, global ocean.Galileo's Europa image data has been, with improved calibrations to produce acolor image approximating what the human eye might see.Europa's long curving fractures.  The tidal flexing the large moon experiencesin its elliptical orbitaround Jupiter supplies the energy to keep the ocean liquid.But more is the possibilitythat even in theabsence of sunlight that process could also supply the energy tosupport life,one of the best places to look for lifebeyond Earth.The Juno spacecraft currently in Jovian orbithas also made repeated flybys of the water world,returning images along with data exploring.This October will see the launch of the NASA'son a voyage of.The spacecraft will make nearly 50 flybys,approaching to within 25 kilometers of Europa's icy surface.
