Peveril Castle was once a medieval fortress, standing tall on a limestone outcrop. Its ruins now overlook the village of Castleton in the Peak District in Derbyshire, England. Construction of the castle began shortly after the Norman conquest in the 11th century, although it wasn&amp;rsquo;t completed until the 14th century. From the castle, visitors can enjoy views of Cave Dale, a ravine that was carved by glacial meltwater over many years.</description>
