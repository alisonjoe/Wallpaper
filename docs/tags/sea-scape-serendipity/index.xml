Get ready to explore the offbeat charm of Rameswaram Island! Occupying a significant position between peninsular India and Sri Lanka, this island, also known as Pamban Island, is within the Adam&amp;rsquo;s Bridge (Ram Setu) archipelago. As the second-largest island in the region, it is anchored by the pilgrimage hub of Rameswaram, a bustling town steeped in spiritual significance. Here, spanning across the waters of the Indian Ocean, Pamban Bridge is a vital railway link, connecting the town of Mandapam on mainland India with Rameswaram on the Island.</description>
