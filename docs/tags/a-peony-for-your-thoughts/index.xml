In the spring of 1862, a horticultural event began that would go on to become world famous—the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS) Chelsea Flower Show. Formally known as the Great Spring Show, it has flourished through the years, even surviving wartime interruptions. Today, it continues to be a symbol of excellence in the world of gardening. Starting today and running until May 25, a symphony of colours, textures and scents will greet people from all walks of life, including British royalty at the Royal Hospital Chelsea.</description>
