What wonders appear when the Moon blocks the Sun?For many eager observers of of the Sun, the suddenly dark sky included the expected corona and two (perhaps surprise) planets: .Normally, in recent days, Venus is visible only in the morning when the Sun and Jupiter are below the horizon, while Jupiter appears bright only in the evening. On Monday, though, for well-placed observers, both planets became easily visible during the day right in line with the .</description>

The arms of a grand design spiral galaxy 60,000 light-years across areunwound in this digital transformation of the magnificent 2005.In fact, M51 is one of the original spiral nebulae, its windingarms described by a mathematical curve known as a, a spiral whose separation grows in away with increasing distance from the center.Applying logarithms to shift the pixelcoordinates in the Hubble image relative to the center of M51 mapsthe galaxy&amp;rsquo;s spiral arms into diagonal straight lines.</description>

      <description>Is this one galaxy or two? This question came to light in 1950 when astronomerchanced upon this unusual extragalactic object. On the outside is a dominated by bright blue stars,while near the center lies a ball of much redder starsthat are likely much older. Between the two is a that appears almost completely dark. How formed, including its nearly of stars and gas, remains unknown. Genesis hypotheses include abillions of years ago and the gravitational effect of a that has.</description>
