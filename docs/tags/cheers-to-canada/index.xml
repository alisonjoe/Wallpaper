Today, Canada celebrates its national day. It commemorates the passing of the British North America Act, 1867, which joined together three British colonies, the Union of Canada, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia, under the self-governing country of Canada. The anniversary of the Confederation was called Dominion Day until 1982, when Canada became fully independent of the Parliament of the United Kingdom and the celebration was officially renamed Canada Day.</description>
