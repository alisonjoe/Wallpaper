Featured here are reticulated giraffes, found mostly in Kenya, but also in parts of Somalia and Ethiopia. Giraffes have fascinated travellers from around the world for a long time. These animals were viewed as symbols of status and treasured as pets among royalty. Their coats feature large, polygonal-shaped spots that extend onto the lower legs, tail and face. Unfortunately, only around 16,000 reticulated giraffes remain in the wild, less than half of the approximately 36,000 recorded in the 1980s.</description>
