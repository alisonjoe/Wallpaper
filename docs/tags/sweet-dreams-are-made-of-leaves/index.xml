This sleepy koala may inspire you to catch some Z&amp;rsquo;s. These adorable Australian marsupials can sleep up to 20 hours a day, which helps them conserve the little energy they get from their eucalyptus-based diet. Koalas move slowly when awake, spend most of their time tucked into nooks in trees, and have a lower body temperature than other animals of their size. The koala is an arboreal herbivorous marsupial, it is uniquely adapted to its native habitat.</description>
