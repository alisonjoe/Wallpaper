Starting in 1977 as part of Queen Elizabeth II's silver jubilee celebrations, the Brit Awards have grown to become the biggest night in the British music industry's calendar. There are 15 awards up for grabs, and nominees include Blur and Little Simz. Hosted by Maya Jama, Clara Amfo and Roman Kemp, this year's ceremony takes place live from London's O2 Arena. A star-studded roster of performers includes Dua Lipa and Raye, who bagged record-breaking seven nods. So, tune in, turn up and get ready for an evening of amazing music."
