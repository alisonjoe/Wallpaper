Running from the Isarco Valley to the heart of Puez-Odle Natural Park, the valley offers a spectacular view of the surrounding mountains. With a large selection of hiking paths, such as the Adolf Munkel Trail, it is also an ideal destination for hikers. In addition, Val di Funes is rich in cultural heritage. Several historic churches have been built here, including the Santa Maddalena Church, a true treasure from the 14th century. What truly sets this valley apart, though, is its peaceful rhythm of life, seemingly untouched by time. Here, amongst the storied peaks, you'll find a world that moves to the silent cadence of nature—a gentle reminder of life's sublime beauty. Whether you seek solitude or adventure, Val di Funes beckons with open arms and timeless charm."
