This Formula One showdown is all set to bring a rush of adrenaline to the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve in Montreal. Named after Canada's homegrown racing hero Gilles Villeneuve, the track has witnessed legendary moments, like Lewis Hamilton's maiden win in 2007, and Jacques Villeneuve racing across his father's namesake circuit. Each lap around the 4.361-kilometre circuit is as unpredictable as it is thrilling, with drivers navigating 70 laps with 14 turns each, including the infamous 'Wall of Champions'—a spot where many racing legends, like Michael Schumacher, have faced hardships."
