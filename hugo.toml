Various events around the world are held in June to honour and celebrate the LGBTQIA+ community, their history, achievements and ongoing pursuit for equality. This month, vibrant parades hit the streets and buildings light up in the colours of the rainbow—a symbol of the LGBTQIA+ social movements—in numerous cities to praise freedom for all."
