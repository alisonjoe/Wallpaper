India's oldest national park was established in 1936 and named after the naturalist and conservationist Jim Corbett. Housed in the foothills of the Himalayas near the popular hill-station of Nainital, the Jim Corbett National Park is known for its significant tiger population. During the summer months, the park becomes a bustling hub of wildlife activity, with Indian elephants frequently spotted roaming in herds numbering several hundred. As part of the Terai Arc Landscape Programme, the park is among the thirteen protected areas targeted for preservation and restoration. The overarching goal of this programme is ambitious yet crucial: to safeguard three of the most iconic terrestrial species, namely the tiger, the Asian elephant and the great one-horned rhinoceros."
