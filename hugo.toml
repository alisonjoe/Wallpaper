Belonging to species within the Neobatrachia suborder, it is characterised by its arboreal lifestyle, spending a significant portion of its life in trees. Despite their diverse origins within Neobatrachia, these tree-dwelling frogs share the common adaptation of inhabiting arboreal environments. They tend to be small and slender since their weight has to be supported by branches and twigs in their habitats. They can be recognised by the sticky discs on the tips of their fingers and toes, which help them cling to surfaces. The American green tree frog is the official state amphibian of both Louisiana and Georgia."
