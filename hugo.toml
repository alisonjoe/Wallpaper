Kaptai Lake in Rangamati District is home to the floating market of seasonal fruits seen in today's image. However, Kaptai's charm lies deeper. The lake was created in 1961 to generate hydropower, submerging not just land and the palace of the king of the Chakmas but a way of life, displacing 100,000 people. Yet resilience bore out; communities adapted, and now, their buoyant bazaar has become a livelihood. Here, farmers navigate their wooden vessels along the bank to engage with eager buyers. You leave with a bag full of fresh fruits or just a bunch of unforgettable memories, whatever floats your boat."
