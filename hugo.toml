What started as a small gathering of artistic minds in 1967 has evolved into a treasure trove of the arts, dazzling visitors every May. Starting today, the festival will see a tapestry of over 120 eclectic events that will last until May 26. Adults and children alike are invited to revel in a world where literature leaps off the page, music fills the air and circus acts defy gravity. From Nadia Shireen's live podcasts with literary giants to Scott Silven's English-exclusive magic show, 'Wonders', this year's festival is an oasis of premieres and exclusives. So, are you ready for Brighton to take to the stage?"
