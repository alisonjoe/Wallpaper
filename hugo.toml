This cherished holiday, falling on the Monday preceding May 25, honours Queen Victoria's birthday and unofficially marks the beginning of summer. Queen Victoria reigned from 1837 to 1901, and this holiday was established in 1845. The traditional ceremony begins in New Westminster with a 21-gun salute followed by the playing of the national anthem. Although it is observed differently across the country, Parliament Hill in Ottawa hosts the Trooping the Colour, a ceremony held to mark the official birthday of the former British Sovereign. Throughout the day various events are organised, including concerts and cultural performances. As dusk settles, the sky lights up with fireworks and eyes turn skyward, sharing a moment of national pride and nostalgia—a festive bridge connecting the past to the present."
